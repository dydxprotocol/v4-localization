      "FAQ_WHAT_ARE_THE_RISKS_OF_STAKING_ANSWER": "Use of any DeFi protocol comes with risks. In the case of staking, it is important to understand that unstaking tokens takes 30 days, which means there is a period of illiquidity during which you will not be able to transfer your tokens, even in the case of protocol or market volatility. Additionally, users should do their own due diligence on validators before staking their assets with one. Validators who violate protocol rules may be penalized by having tokens staked to them slashed (i.e. burned) or being jailed which will prevent them from earning rewards.",
      "FAQ_WHAT_IS_STAKING_QUESTION": "What is staking?",
      "FAQ_WHAT_IS_STAKING_ANSWER": "dYdX Chain uses Proof-of-Stake for its consensus mechanism. Token holders can stake their tokens to validators in order to help secure the network and validate transactions, and in exchange earn USDC rewards from trading and gas fees that the protocol collects. All fees are paid to stakers, less any fees sent to the insurance fund and validator commissions. Reward rates are based on data from {HERE_LINK}. There is no guarantee of future reward rates, which may fluctuate based on protocol conditions.",

This site permits you to stake to any validator in the active set that is not jailed, and you may stake to any validator not shown on this site by using an alternate portal such as {KEPLR_LINK}.
